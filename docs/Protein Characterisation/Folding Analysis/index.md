# Folding Analysis by NMR 

 The purpose of this protocol is to clarify the basic requirements for both unlabelled (natural-abundance) and uniform ^15^N-labelled protein for folding analysis by NMR.

## Unlabelled protein preparation

### Prior to set-up

- [ ] Protein must be purified and in PBS buffer (<pH 7 and not within 0.5 of the proteins isoelectric point (pI)) prior to NMR acquisition.
- [ ] Protein Concentration should be 100-500 &micro;M (lower concentrations subject to approval) and protein size should be <20 kDa (higher MWT proteins subject to approval).
- [ ] Sample volume 500 &micro;L or more.

#### Additional information required

- [ ] Amino acid sequence (for determining predicted secondary structure elements, pI and stability)
- [ ] Purification strategy employed (tris SEC, imidazole gradient Hitrap etc. any expression or purification tags) to establish impurities and their sources.
- [ ] Purification tag used (and whether still intact or cleaved).
- [ ] Any other known sample requirements to aid stability (temperature, divalent ions)

### At NMR set-up

1. Add 10% D~2~O to pure protein in solution 
2. Add 600 &micro;L to 5 mm outer diameter NMR tube

### NMR acquisition

^1^H 1D NMR experiment (excitation sculpting) takes 10-30 minutes.

Can be acquired at desired temperature (between 5-40 &deg;C).

### Output

^1^H Characterisation is **limited to** linewidth and dispersion of peaks to suggest consistent with

- Expected molecular weight (not oligomerised)
- Expected secondary structure elements are present
- Characteristics of folded protein are met



## ^15^N uniformly labelled protein preparation

### Prior to set-up

- [ ] Protein must be purified and in phosphate buffer (<pH 7 and not within 0.5 of the proteins isoelectric point p*I* ) prior to NMR acquisition. For labelled proteins other beffers may be used (Tris, Acetate etc. but please consult with facility staff first)
- [ ] Protein Concentration should be 50-500 &micro;M (lower concentrations subject to approval) and protein size should be <20 kDa (higher MWT proteins subject to approval).
- [ ] Sample volume 500 &micro;L or more.

#### Additional information required

- [ ] Amino acid sequence (for determining predicted secondary structure elements, pI and stability).
- [ ] Purification strategy employed (tris SEC, imidazole gradient Hitrap etc. any expression or purification tags) to establish impurities and their sources.
- [ ] Purification tag used (and whether still intact or cleaved).
- [ ] Any other known sample requirements to aid stability (temperature, divalent ions, TCEP etc).

### At NMR set-up

1. Add 10% D~2~O to pure protein in solution 
2. Add 600 &micro;L to 5 mm outer diameter NMR tube

### NMR acquisition

^1^H 1D NMR experiment (excitation sculpting) takes 10-30 minutes, ^1^H-^15^N 2D experiment (HSQC of SFHMBC) takes 1-2 hours.

Can be acquired at desired temperature (between 5-40 &deg;C).

Can be acquired as a time series (1 hour acquisitions over a period of days) to establish stability.

### Output

^1^H Characterisation includes linewidth and dispersion of peaks to suggest consistent with:

- Expected molecular weight (not oligomerised)
- Expected secondary structure elements are present
- Characteristics of folded protein are met

**In addition**, ^15^N characterisation enables appraisal of

- Number of amino acids visible in sample
- Presence of secondary structure elements (disordered vs globular)
- Suggested secondary structure elements (beta-sheet and alpha helices)

Extended analysis where protein annotation exists in BMRB (or prior analysis in NMR Facility)

- Superimposition of known amino acid annotation will be provided
