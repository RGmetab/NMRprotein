# Matching BMRB peaks

The purpose of this protocol is to demonstrate how to match an in-house ^1^H ^15N^ HSQC Protein spectrum to annotation downloaded in star format (.str) from the BMRB.

Youtube demos available [here](https://www.tinyurl.com/nmrbox).

## Download .str from BMRB

Look-up protein of interest on [BMRB]( https://bmrb.io/ ) and download associated star (version3) file (as text).



## Open in house ^1^H ^15^N Protein HSQC in CCPN software

> For ease of access it is recommended that you use [NMRbox](https://nmrbox.org/).

1.  Register for a free NMRbox account [here](https://nmrbox.org/signup).

	> NMRbox account activation can take up to 3 days.

2. Then install the free software [RealVNC viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/).

3. OpenVNC viewer and input a suitable NMRbox host (such as carbon.nmrbox.org)
4. Login with your NMRbox username and password.

5. Launch CCPN assign (type `assign` in the terminal).
6. Drag `spectrum` folder provided by the NMR Facility into the window marked `drop area`.

You should now have an interactive view of the ^1^H ^15^N HSQC spectrum.



## Add BMRB star file to the CCPN project

You can now drag and drop the `.str` file you downloaded from the BMRB in to the CCPN project. 

A pop-up window called IMPORT from NMRSTAR should open.

Click on `Simulate peaks from atom` and proceed (ignore warning that this feature is to be updated).

Now in the right hand list you should have two items under `Spectra` one will have the number from the HSQC folder and the other will be the newly imported peaklist. Expand that item and the peaklist within you can drag the peaklist â€˜PL:NH and overlay on top of your spectra. 



## Check the match between annotation and spectra

There may be a slight offset, but you should see that the location and number of annotations matches the peaks within your spectrum.
